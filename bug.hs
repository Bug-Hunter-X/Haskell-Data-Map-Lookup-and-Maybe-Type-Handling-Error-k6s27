This Haskell code attempts to use the `Data.Map` library to efficiently store and retrieve key-value pairs.  However, it makes a common mistake in handling the `Maybe` type returned by `Data.Map.lookup`.

```haskell
import qualified Data.Map as Map

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let myMap = Map.fromList [(1, "a"), (2, "b"), (3, "c")]
  let value = Map.lookup 2 myMap
  print value  -- This prints "Just "b""
  let otherValue = Map.lookup 4 myMap
  print otherValue -- This prints "Nothing"
  let result = value + otherValue -- ERROR!  Can't add Maybe types
  print result
```
