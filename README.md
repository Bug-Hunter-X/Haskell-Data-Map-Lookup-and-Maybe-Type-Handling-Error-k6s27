This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell when using the `Data.Map` library: incorrect handling of the `Maybe` type returned by `Map.lookup`. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.hs` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to perform arithmetic operations directly on `Maybe` values without proper pattern matching or using functions like `fromMaybe`.
